### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Niranjan Nair from India, a passionate designer and developer. Coding isn't just a hobby for me; it's a part of who I am, and I can't imagine my life without it. My journey into the world of programming began with the introduction to Scratch, and since then, I've been hooked. Currently, I'm immersed in learning and creating websites using HTML, CSS, and JS.

Beyond coding, I have a deep fascination for astronomy and stay updated on the latest news in the field. My curiosity extends to exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

My interests extend to sports, particularly chess and football. I'm an avid follower of the Indian Super League (ISL), and when it comes to supporting a team, Kerala Blasters FC holds a special place in my heart.

In addition to the screen and the sports field, I am an avid reader with a keen interest in geopolitics. Whether it's delving into the intricacies of global affairs or getting lost in the pages of a good book, I relish the opportunity to broaden my horizons and discover new perspectives.
